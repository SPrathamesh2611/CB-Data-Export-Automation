# CB-Data-Export-Automation
This Python script automates the extraction, transformation, and export of CB (Credit Bureau) data from a SQL Server database, generates specific output files with formatted headers/footers, and renames the final outputs with a .cdf extension. It supports multiple credit bureau formats such as Highmark, CIBIL, and Equifax.
